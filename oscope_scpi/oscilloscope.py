#  Control of Oscilloscopes with PyVISA and SCPI command set. This started as
#  specific code for the HP/Agilent/Keysight MSO-X/DSO-X 3000A Oscilloscope and
#  has been made more generic to be used with Agilent UXR and MXR Oscilloscopes.
#  The hope is that these commands in this package are generic enough to be
#  used with other brands but may need to make this an Agilent specific
#  package in the future if find that not to be true.
